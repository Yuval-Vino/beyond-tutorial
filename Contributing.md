# Issues
### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. We assign issues to specific contributors, although you are more than welcome to open a PR with a fix if you find an issue to work on.

### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.
Issue reporting guidelines

•	 When describing issues try to phrase your issue in terms of the behavior you think needs changing rather than the code you think needs changing.

•	If reporting a bug, then try to include a pull request with a failing test case. This will help us quickly identify if there is a valid issue, and make sure that it gets fixed more quickly if there is one.

•	Closing an issue doesn't necessarily mean the end of a discussion. If you believe your issue has been closed incorrectly, explain why and we'll consider if it needs to be reopened.
